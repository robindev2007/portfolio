Next.js is a lightning-fast [React](https://react.dev/) framework trusted by data-heavy streaming sites like Hulu and Netflix. If you’re already versed in React, you should definitely get to know this increasingly popular technology.

Though both React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) help create effective web user interfaces, they have some key differences: Next.js is more feature-rich and opinionated than React. It is especially well-suited for websites focused on search engine optimization (SEO) or pre-rendering.

## Next.js vs. React

React, which debuted in 2013, is much more established than Next.js. But the younger framework, released in 2016, is growing in popularity, with more than [113K GitHub stars](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) as of October 2023 and millions of weekly npm downloads. Let’s see a basic Next.js vs. React performance comparison that breaks down when to use Next.js vs. React:

- **Development speed**: Next.js provides out-of-the-box features that ease the development process for making an advanced React app. With the introduction of its own compiler in Next.js 12, the framework also increased build speeds. Compared to React, Next.js reduces the amount of time an engineer needs to wait for code to refresh, minimizing developer frustration and slowdowns.
- **Data fetching and load times**: Next.js can traverse the React tree and query for data in the server, allowing for pre-loaded page data. This often results in lower application load times for pages served by Next.js compared to pages written in vanilla React.
- **Rendering and SEO**: Next.js offers pre-rendering, whereas React uses client-side rendering. Pre-rendered pages enable effective SEO strategies that are challenging to achieve in a plain React app.
- **Routing**: Next.js provides a structured, predefined file system for routing. Its system offers reduced flexibility compared to React’s various library options (e.g., React Router), but simplifies page setup and routing.
  React serves a variety of project types very well, including user dashboards, back-end systems, internal organization tools, and data visualization systems. Next.js is the ideal toolkit with which to enhance React applications that benefit from the power of pre-rendering, including e-commerce stores, social media apps, ticket-booking systems, and education platforms. Let’s explore some of its use cases in more detail, so you can answer the question, “Should I use Next.js?”

## Rendering in Next.js

Rendering is the process that converts React code into HTML that the browser then displays as the page’s user interface. Next.js provides three rendering methods—client-side rendering (CSR), server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG)—and the added bonus of incremental static regeneration (ISR). ISR combines server-side rendering with a semi-static caching mechanism that relieves server load and provides speeds similar to those achieved by a static site.

Server-side rendering and static site generation fall under the umbrella of pre-rendering, in which HTML pages are generated before being sent to the client side. A great advantage of using Next.js is that it adds powerful support for pre-rendering React apps.

## Client-side Rendering

Client-side rendering is the default for vanilla React applications. This method generates the page’s HTML on the client side. In other words, rendering efforts take place in the user’s browser, and JavaScript from the user’s device generates the HTML. The UI appears after the rendering is complete, when the webpage is also interactive (i.e., hydrated).

CSR is possible for Next.js components using React’s `useEffect` or `useSWR`.

## Server-side Rendering

Next.js also enables the generation of a page’s HTML on the server. In this case, the generated HTML is sent to the client so that the webpage’s UI appears before hydration. Then, the viewable webpage is ready for interaction after the client finishes initializing the JavaScript.

On pages where we want Next.js to perform server-side rendering, some simple configuration functions are added to the page.

## Static Site Generation

Next.js also offers static site generation, in which all static HTML pages are rendered from the JavaScript at build time. Generating a static site from a React code base requires more upfront build time compared to a React single-page application. However, the payoff here is having static content that can be served and cached at the maximum speed allowed by the site content without the computational overhead of SSR.
