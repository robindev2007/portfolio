## What is React?

React is a front-end JavaScript library that allows you to build user interfaces from reusable UI components. React uses server-side rendering to provide a flexible and performance-based solution. It allows developers to create seamless UX and complex UI. Furthermore, for an ultimate experience with UI/UX, you can get the best help from React frontend development services.

Since React follows the “Learn Once, Write Anywhere” principle, it’s the preferred choice for developers to build fast and scalable applications. Along with JavaScript, React can also be used with JSX. Developed by Facebook, React is maintained by Facebook communities and individual developers.
